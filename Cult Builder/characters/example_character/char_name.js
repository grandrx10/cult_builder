    /** READ ME: each character is on a dialogue_path, which determines what they are saying.
     * 
     * DIALOGUE:
     * 
     * The dialogue is in chronological order. Without any parameters, one will proceed to the next.
     * Each dialogue_path must be encompassed by square brackets: [ "Example text here!" , "Second text here!" ]
     * 
     * If you wish to use a stat from cult_stats, you must refer to it in brackets within the text.
     * [ "Your name is [name]" ] <- this will replace with [name] with the corresponding stat in cult_stats.
     * 
     * To set the speaker of your dialogue, add {Speaker:char_name} to the front of your text.
     * {Speaker:} will set the speaker to no one. This can be used for narration.
     *  
     * To move from one dialogue path to the other, just add (Go) to the start of your text.
     * Example: [ "(Go)example_2_dialogue_path" ]  <- this makes the character move to dialogue path example_2_dialogue_path
     * 
     * To make a choice, add (Choice) then the name of the choice. Please consult char_name_choices.js and make sure your choice is there
     * Example: [ "(Choice)example_choice" ] 
     *
     * To end a dialogue, add (End), then the begginning of the next dialogue path for that character.
     * Example: [ "(End)last_example_dialogue_path" ]
     * 
     * IMAGES:
     * 
     * To display images, make sure to load images at the bottom of this class.
     * {name_of_image:display_location} <- this will display the desired image at the desired location
     * {Edlith:middle} <- example display
     * Possible display locations are: middle, left, right
     * Note: No spaces are allowed in this statement. Mind capitals.
     * 
     * VARIABLES:
     * If you want to change cult_stats variables, add <> at the front of your dialogue sentence.
     * If your variable is not already in cult_stats, it will create that variable. You may add any positive or negative number.
     * You may also change multiple cult_stats. (You may use add or set)
     * [ "<name_of_variable:add:value_here>Example text here!" ] or [ "<var1:add:value_here><var2:set:value_here>Example text here!" ]
     * 
     * If you want dialogue to ONLY appear when certain stats are fulfilled, then do this:
     * [ "<name_of_variable:more/less:value_here>Example text here!" ]
     * Note: choose either more or less. They are inclusive.
